# Collaborative Digital Exhibit – Student Workflow

This document outlines the step‑by‑step process you will follow to research, write, review, and synthesize a perspective on the decision to drop the atomic bomb.

## Phase 1: Topic Selection and Initial Research (Using GitHub Issues)

1. **Browse the Issues**
   - Go to the repository’s **Issues** tab.
   - Find the five issues labeled `research‑topic`:
     1. The Political Perspective – President Truman's Dilemma
     2. The Military Perspective – Arguments for a Land Invasion vs. The Bomb
     3. The Scientific Perspective – J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project Scientists
     4. The Diplomatic Perspective – The Role of the Soviet Union and the Potsdam Declaration
     5. The Moral/Ethical Perspective – The Debate Among Scientists and Officials

2. **Claim a Topic**
   - Choose **one** issue that interests you.
   - Assign the issue to yourself (use the **Assignees** field on the right).
   - Add a comment to the issue briefly outlining your initial research plan (e.g., which sources you will consult, what key questions you plan to answer).

## Phase 2: Drafting and Submission (Using Branches and Pull Requests)

1. **Create a Branch**
   - From the repository’s main page, click the branch selector (it says `main`).
   - Type a descriptive branch name (e.g., `truman-political-dilemma`, `military-invasion-vs-bomb`).
   - Click **Create branch**.

2. **Draft Your Analysis**
   - Navigate to the `perspectives/` folder.
   - Create a new Markdown file with a name that matches your topic (e.g., `truman-analysis.md`).
   - Use the template in `perspectives/template.md` as a guide.
   - Write a thorough, well‑sourced analysis of your assigned perspective.
   - Save and commit your file to your branch.

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to the **Pull requests** tab and click **New pull request**.
   - Set **base** to `main` and **compare** to your branch.
   - Give the PR a clear title, e.g., “Draft: Analysis of Truman's Political Dilemma”.
   - In the PR description, include:
     - A summary of your key findings.
     - Two specific discussion questions for your peers to consider.
   - Click **Create pull request**.

## Phase 3: Peer Review and Revision (Using Pull Request Review Features)

1. **Review Assignments**
   - The teacher will assign two reviewers to your PR.
   - You will also be assigned as a reviewer for two other PRs (on topics you are **not** writing about).

2. **Conduct a Review**
   - Open the PR you are assigned to review.
   - Click **Files changed** to see the diff.
   - Use the **Review changes** dropdown to start a review.
   - Add at least **three inline comments** that are constructive and critical. Examples:
     - Ask for clarification on a source.
     - Challenge an interpretation with counter‑evidence.
     - Suggest areas where the analysis could be expanded.
   - Submit your review with **Request changes** or **Approve** as appropriate.

3. **Respond and Revise**
   - As an author, read the reviewers’ comments on your PR.
   - Reply to each comment (use the reply button) to acknowledge or explain.
   - Push new commits to your branch to address the feedback.
   - Mark resolved comments as resolved when you have addressed them.

4. **Approval and Merge**
   - Once reviewers are satisfied, they will approve the PR.
   - The teacher will give final approval and **merge the PR** using the “Squash and merge” strategy.
   - After merging, your analysis will appear in the `perspectives/` folder on the `main` branch.

## Phase 4: Synthesis and Conclusion (Using Issues and a Final PR)

1. **Synthesis Issue**
   - After all five perspective PRs are merged, the teacher will open Issue #6: **Synthesize a Conclusion**.
   - The entire class will use the issue’s comment thread to discuss how the perspectives fit together and outline a final conclusion.

2. **Draft the Conclusion**
   - A volunteer (or small group) will create a new branch and draft the `conclusion.md` file based on the class discussion.
   - The draft should integrate insights from all five perspectives and present a cohesive historical interpretation.

3. **Final Review and Merge**
   - Open a PR for the conclusion.
   - All students review the conclusion and provide feedback.
   - Once consensus is reached, the teacher merges the conclusion into `main`.

## Final Product

After all phases are complete, the `main` branch will contain:
- Five peer‑reviewed analysis files in `perspectives/`
- A collaboratively written `conclusion.md`
- A complete digital exhibit ready for presentation.

## Tips for Success

- **Start early** – Research and writing take time.
- **Cite your sources** – Use footnotes or in‑text citations; include a references section.
- **Be respectful** – Peer review should be constructive, not personal.
- **Ask for help** – Use issue comments or classroom discussions if you are stuck.

Happy researching! 🧑‍🏫📚
