# Issue #6: Synthesize a Conclusion

**Issue Description:** This issue represents the final phase of the project. After all five perspectives have been researched, written, and peer‑reviewed, the class will collaborate to synthesize a conclusion that integrates the multiple perspectives.

**Student Instructions:**
1. Do not claim this issue individually.
2. Instead, after each perspective has been merged into the main branch, this issue will be used for discussion and coordination.
3. A group of two or three students will be responsible for drafting the conclusion file (`conclusion.md`) based on the consensus built in the issue comments.

**Suggested Steps:**
- Read through all five perspective analyses.
- Identify common themes and areas of disagreement.
- Discuss how the interplay of different perspectives shaped the final outcome.
- Draft a conclusion that explains how the different perspectives contributed to the decision to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
- Submit a pull request with the conclusion file for final review by the entire class.

**Deadline:** To be determined after all five perspective PRs are merged.
