# Atomic Bomb Decision Exhibit

## Project Goals

This repository hosts a collaboratively researched and curated digital exhibit exploring the multifaceted decision-making process behind the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The exhibit aims to:
- Present distinct viewpoints from key figures and groups involved in the decision.
- Analyze the interplay between political, military, scientific, diplomatic, and ethical perspectives.
- Encourage critical thinking and synthesis of diverse historical interpretations.
- Demonstrate collaborative research and peer‑review workflows using GitHub.

## Repository Structure

- `perspectives/` – Contains individual analysis files for each research topic.
- `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the project.
- (Future) `conclusion.md` – A class‑wide synthesis of the different perspectives.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Topic Selection** – Students claim a research topic by assigning themselves to one of the pre‑defined GitHub Issues labeled `research‑topic`.
2. **Initial Research** – Students outline their research plan in a comment on the issue.
3. **Drafting** – Each student creates a branch, writes their analysis in a Markdown file inside `perspectives/`, and opens a Pull Request (PR).
4. **Peer Review** – Two assigned reviewers provide inline feedback using GitHub’s review tools. The author revises their draft based on the feedback.
5. **Merge** – After approval, the PR is merged (squash‑and‑merge) into the `main` branch, adding the finalized analysis to the exhibit.
6. **Synthesis** – The class collaborates on a final `conclusion.md` file that integrates the various perspectives.

## Research Topics (Issues)

The following research topics are available as GitHub Issues:

1. **The Political Perspective – President Truman's Dilemma**
2. **The Military Perspective – Arguments for a Land Invasion vs. The Bomb**
3. **The Scientific Perspective – J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project Scientists**
4. **The Diplomatic Perspective – The Role of the Soviet Union and the Potsdam Declaration**
5. **The Moral/Ethical Perspective – The Debate Among Scientists and Officials**

## Getting Started

1. **Claim a topic** by assigning the corresponding issue to yourself.
2. **Create a branch** named after your topic (e.g., `truman-political-dilemma`).
3. **Draft your analysis** in `perspectives/[topic]-analysis.md`.
4. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear title and a summary of your findings.
5. **Review your peers’ work** when assigned as a reviewer.
6. **Revise your draft** based on reviewer comments.

## Final Deliverable

The `main` branch will become a polished digital exhibit containing all peer‑reviewed analyses and a collective conclusion, created through a structured, multi‑tool workflow that mimics academic research and publication.
